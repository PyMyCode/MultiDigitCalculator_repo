## Building a Handwritten Multi-Digit Calculator
### Using Convolutional Neural Networks (Keras API with Tensorflow backend)

The aim of this project is to :

- Create a CNN model that can identify digits and simple mathematical operators from an image
- Set up the mathematical expression and compute the answer
- If incorrect, update the model with the correct answer
