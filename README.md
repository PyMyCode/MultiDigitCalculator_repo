## Building a Handwritten Multi-Digit Calculator
### Using Convolutional Neural Networks (Keras API with Tensorflow backend)

TODOS:
- find an operator set
- [Potential data source_2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols)

### Dataset Descirption

- Each image 28*28=784 pixels
- Each pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255 (light to dark)
- 42000 entries

The aim of this project is to :

- Create a CNN model that can identify digits and simple mathematical operators from an image
- Set up the mathematical expression and compute the answer
- If incorrect, update the model with the correct answer
